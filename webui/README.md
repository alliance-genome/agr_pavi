# PAVI Web UI
This subdirectory contains all code and configs for the PAVI web UI component.

The web UI code is written in typescript, so follows the [general dependency management](/README.md#dependency-management) and [javascript/typescript](/README.md#javascript-components) PAVI coding guidelines.

It is built using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a [react](https://react.dev/) framework that enables usage of both client and server components, server-side caching and much more.

This project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/v14.2.3/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To run the development server:
```bash
make run-server-dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
